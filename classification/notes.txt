Notes from Aadithya Prakash:
Round 1:
	Take in data and spit it out into a raw file. basically 
	(clenched, Voltage)
	(clenched, Voltage)
	(clenched, Voltage)

	Then perform calculations on the data using 
	Lamba functions on moving window

	Create arf file after performing calculations on the moving window

	Then use weka to classify data

Round 2:
Getting values from ADC/Interrupts and shit. Get a bunch of data. Then print out classification to terminal

Sliding window algorith. Look at data from 0-3s. Overlap window of 1.5 window. 0-3 then 1.5-4.5. Code in the sliding window. Use interupts, analog in and all the jazz


Make skeleton arf file that weka will not reject
with input folder and output arf file
Now that we have functions make them print out into correctly formatted arf file
